<p>The first step is to create an object that represents each phase.</p>
<p>A simple complete program that creates an object representing a gas mixture and prints its temperature is shown below. </p>
<div class="fragment"></div><!-- fragment --><p>Class <a class="el" href="classCantera_1_1ThermoPhase.html">ThermoPhase </a> is the base class for Cantera classes that represent phases of matter. It defines the public interface for all classes that represent phases. For example, it specifies that they all have a method <code>temperature()</code> that returns the current temperature, a method <code>setTemperature(double T)</code> that sets the temperature, a method <code>getChemPotentials(double* mu)</code> that writes the species chemical potentials into array <code>mu</code>, and so on.</p>
<p>Class ThermoPhase can be used to represent the intensive state of any single-phase solution of multiple species. The phase may be a bulk, three-dimensional phase (a gas, a liquid, or a solid), or may be a two-dimensional surface phase, or even a one-dimensional "edge" phase. The specific attributes of each type of phase are specified by deriving a class from ThemoPhase and providing implementations for the virtual methods of ThermoPhase.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="The"></a>
Intensive Thermodynamic State</h1>
<p>Class ThermoPhase and classes derived from it work only with the intensive thermodynamic state. That is, all extensive properties (enthalpy, entropy, internal energy, volume, etc.) are computed for a unit quantity (on a mass or mole basis). For example, there is a method enthalpy_mole() that returns the molar enthalpy (J/kmol), and a method enthalpy_mass() that returns the specific enthalpy (J/kg), but no method enthalpy() that would return the total enthalpy (J). This is because class ThermoPhase does not store the total amount (mass or mole) of the phase.</p>
<p>From thermodynamics, it may be shown that the intensive state of a single-component phase in equilibrium is fully specified by the values of any r+1 independent thermodynamic properties, where r is the number of reversible work modes. If the only reversible work mode is compression (a "simple compressible substance"), then two properties suffice to specify the intensive state.</p>
<p>In principle, any two independent p</p>
<p>specified, the values of all other intensive properties may be computed. For example, specifying the pressure and molar entropy</p>
<p>consisting of a solution of K species in equilibrium is fully specified by the values of any two independent thermodynamic properties, in addition to in Class ThermoPhase stores internally the values of the temperature, the mass density, and the mass fractions of all species. These values are sufficient to fix the intensive thermodynamic state of the phase. All properties for a unit amount (on a mass or mole basis) are determined once the intensive state is specified. For the extensive properties, class ThermoPhase provides methods that return property values on a molar basis (e.g. enthalpy_mole(), with units J/kmol) or on a mass basis (e.g. enthalpy_mass(), with units J/kg). Since the total mass or total number of moles is not stored,</p>
<p>Note that the total mass or number of moles is not stored</p>
<p>Given these values, any other intensive thermodynamic property may</p>
<p>Note that the total mass or total number of moles is not stored &ndash; therefore the values of all extensive properties (mass, volume, energy) are</p>
<p>This choice is arbitrary, and for most purposes you can't tell which properties are stored and which are computed.</p>
<p>The classes that derive from ThermoPhase compute o</p>
<p>For example, suppose we want to create a class to use to compute the properties of ideal gas mixtures.</p>
<p>Many of the methods of ThermoPhase are declared virtual, and are meant to be overloaded in classes derived from ThermoPhase. For example, class <a class="el" href="classCantera_1_1IdealGasPhase.html">IdealGasPhase </a> derives from ThermoPhase, and represents ideal gas mixtures.</p>
<p>Although class ThermoPhase defines the interface for all classes representing phases, it only provides implementations for a few of the methods. This is because ThermoPhase does not actually know the equation of state of any phase &ndash; this information is provided by classes that derive from ThermoPhase. The methods implemented by ThermoPhase are ones that apply to all phases, independent of the equation of state. For example, it implements methods temperature() and setTemperature(), since the temperature value is stored internally. Also, the mass density is stored internally, so</p>
<p>There is a list of classes which inherit from the ThermoPhase class (see <a class="el" href="group__thermoprops.html">Thermodynamic Properties</a>)</p>
<p>There is a list of classes which handle standard states for species (see <a class="el" href="group__spthermo.html">Species Standard-State Thermodynamic Properties</a>). </p>
