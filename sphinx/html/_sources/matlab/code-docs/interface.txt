Interface
---------

.. mat:class:: Interface(src, id, p1, p2, p3, p4)

    Interface class constructor.

    See :ref:`sec-interfaces`.
    
    See also: :mat:func:`importEdge`, :mat:func:`importInterface`
    
    :param src:
        CTI or CTML file containing the interface or edge phase.
    :param id:
        Name of the interface or edge phase in the CTI or CTML file.
    :param p1:
        Adjoining phase to the interface.
    :param p2:
        Adjoining phase to the interface.
    :param p3:
        Adjoining phase to the interface.
    :param p4:
        Adjoining phase to the interface.
    :return:
        Instance of class :mat:func:`Interface`
    

    .. mat:function:: concentrations(s)

        Get the concentrations of the species on an interface.

        :param s:
            Instance of class :mat:func:`Interface` with surface species
        :return:
            If no output value is assigned, a bar graph will be plotted.
            Otherwise, a vector of length ``n_surf_species`` will be
            returned.
        

    .. mat:function:: coverages(s)

        Get the surface coverages of the species on an interface.

        :param s:
            Instance of class :mat:func:`Interface` with surface species
        :return:
            If no output value is assigned, a bar graph will be plotted.
            Otherwise, a vector of length ``n_surf_species`` will be
            returned.
        

    .. mat:function:: importEdge(file, name, phase1, phase2, phase3, phase4)

        Import edges between phases.

        Supports up to four neighbor phases. See :ref:`sec-interfaces`
        
        :param file:
            File containing phases
        :param name:
            Name of phase
        :param phase1:
            First neighbor phase
        :param phase2:
            Second neighbor phase
        :param phase3:
            Third neighbor phase
        :param phase4:
            Fourth neighbor phase
        :return:
            Instance of class :mat:func:`Interface`
        

    .. mat:function:: importInterface(file, name, phase1, phase2)

        Import an interface between phases.

        See :ref:`sec-interfaces`.
        
        :param file:
            CTI or CTML file containing the interface
        :param name:
            Name of the interface to import
        :param phase1:
            First phase in the interface
        :param phase2:
            Second phase in the interface
        :return:
            Instance of class :mat:func:`Interface`
        

    .. mat:function:: setCoverages(s, cov, norm)

        Set surface coverages of the species on an interface.

        :param s:
             Instance of class :mat:func:`Interface`
        :param cov:
             Coverage of the species. ``cov`` can be either a vector of
             length ``n_surf_species``, or a string in the format
             ``'Species:Coverage, Species:Coverage'``
        :param norm:
             Optional flag that denotes whether or not to normalize the species
             coverages. ``norm`` is either of the two strings ``'nonorm'``` or
             ``'norm'``. If left unset, the default is `norm`. This only works if
             ``s`` is a vector, not a string. Since unnormalized coverages can lead to
             unphysical results, ``'nonorm'`` should be used only in rare cases, such
             as computing partial derivatives with respect to a species coverage.
