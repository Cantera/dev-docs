Index of Examples
=================

This is an index of the examples included with the Cantera Python module. They
can be found in the `examples` subdirectory of the Cantera Python module's
installation directory. To determine the location of this directory, run the following in your Python interpreter::

    import cantera.examples
    print(cantera.examples.__path__)

Thermodynamics
--------------

:doc:`critical_properties.py <examples/thermo_critical_properties>`:
Print the critical state properties for the fluids for which Cantera has
built-in liquid/vapor equations of state.

:doc:`isentropic.py <examples/thermo_isentropic>`:
Isentropic, adiabatic flow example - calculate area ratio vs. Mach number curve

:doc:`mixing.py <examples/thermo_mixing>`:
Mixing two streams using `Quantity` objects.

:doc:`rankine.py <examples/thermo_rankine>`:
A Rankine vapor power cycle

:doc:`sound_speed.py <examples/thermo_sound_speed>`:
Compute the "equilibrium" and "frozen" sound speeds for a gas


Kinetics
--------

:doc:`extract_submechanism.py <examples/kinetics_extract_submechanism>`:
An example demonstrating how to use Species and Reaction objects to
programmatically extract a reaction submechanism. In this example, the CO/H2
oxidation reactions are extracted from the GRI 3.0 mechanism.

:doc:`mechanism_reduction.py <examples/kinetics_mechanism_reduction>`:
A simplistic approach to mechanism reduction which demonstrates Cantera's
features for dynamically manipulating chemical mechanisms.

:doc:`reaction_path.py <examples/kinetics_reaction_path>`:
Viewing a reaction path diagram.


Transport
---------

:doc:`dusty_gas.py <examples/transport_dusty_gas>`:
Dusty Gas transport model.

:doc:`multiprocessing_viscosity.py <examples/transport_multiprocessing_viscosity>`:
This example demonstrates how Cantera can be used with the 'multiprocessing'
module.


Reactor Networks
----------------

:doc:`NonIdealShockTube.py <examples/reactors_NonIdealShockTube>`:
Non-Ideal Shock Tube Example

:doc:`combustor.py <examples/reactors_combustor>`:
A combustor. Two separate stream - one pure methane and the other air, both at
300 K and 1 atm flow into an adiabatic combustor where they mix and burn.

:doc:`custom.py <examples/reactors_custom>`:
Solve a constant pressure ignition problem where the governing equations are
implemented in Python.

:doc:`ic_engine.py <examples/reactors_ic_engine>`:
Simulation of a (gaseous) Diesel-type internal combustion engine.

Mixing two streams.

:doc:`periodic_cstr.py <examples/reactors_periodic_cstr>`:
This example illustrates a continuously stirred tank reactor (CSTR) with steady
inputs but periodic interior state.

:doc:`pfr.py <examples/reactors_pfr>`:
This example solves a plug-flow reactor problem of hydrogen-oxygen combustion.
The PFR is computed by two approaches: The simulation of a Lagrangian fluid
particle, and the simulation of a chain of reactors.

:doc:`piston.py <examples/reactors_piston>`:
Two reactors separated by a piston

:doc:`reactor1.py <examples/reactors_reactor1>`:
Constant-pressure, adiabatic kinetics simulation.

:doc:`reactor2.py <examples/reactors_reactor2>`:
Two reactors connected with a piston, with heat loss to the environment

:doc:`sensitivity1.py <examples/reactors_sensitivity1>`:
Constant-pressure, adiabatic kinetics simulation with sensitivity analysis

:doc:`surf_pfr.py <examples/reactors_surf_pfr>`:
This example solves a plug flow reactor problem, where the chemistry is
surface chemistry. The specific problem simulated is the partial oxidation of
methane over a platinum catalyst in a packed bed reactor.


One-dimensional Flames
----------------------

:doc:`adiabatic_flame.py <examples/onedim_adiabatic_flame>`:
A freely-propagating, premixed hydrogen flat flame with multicomponent
transport properties.

An opposed-flow ethane/air diffusion flame

:doc:`diffusion_flame_batch.py <examples/onedim_diffusion_flame_batch>`:
This example creates two batches of counterflow diffusion flame simulations.
The first batch computes counterflow flames at increasing pressure, the second
at increasing strain rates.

:doc:`diffusion_flame_extinction.py <examples/onedim_diffusion_flame_extinction>`:
This example computes the extinction point of a counterflow diffusion flame.
A hydrogen-oxygen diffusion flame at 1 bar is studied.

:doc:`flame_fixed_T.py <examples/onedim_flame_fixed_T>`:
A burner-stabilized, premixed methane/air flat flame with multicomponent
transport properties and a specified temperature profile.

:doc:`flamespeed_sensitivity.py <examples/onedim_flamespeed_sensitivity>`:
Sensitivity analysis for a freely-propagating, premixed methane-air
flame. Computes the sensitivity of the laminar flame speed with respect
to each reaction rate constant.
